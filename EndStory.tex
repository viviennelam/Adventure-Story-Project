Well, they haven't seen anything like that before .Without giving a second thought, John and Jay make the leap into the unknown, fueled by number of emotions but mainly curiosity and wonder. Kate does not want to take the risk but she can not leave Jay alone and the fact that she is still lost and without Jay she would not be able to find her way back home, she jumps in too. They have no clue what lies on this side of the world. What lies on the other side is where the real story starts. They finally get a chance to be someone else, or become who they've always wanted to be or even just to live away form who they were. John, Jay and Kate hold their seats for a new experience and wonder whats ahead of them and are surprised how a normal hike became an adventure for Jay, Kate and John.
