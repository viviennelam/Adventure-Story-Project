One sunny day, Jay and Kate went hiking.
This is not your average adventure story
They hiked on a trail that they always hike on, the one with the best views
They come across a new trail that they've never seen before.
Jay says "Let's go down this one!"
Kate looking unsure, says "Are you sure? It looks dangerous."
Jay confidently says "Yes, let's go explore this new trail."
Jay grabs Kate's arm and leads them down the twisty path.
As they walk, the path gets narrower and narrower.
