John, Jay, and Kate all froze... They were confused and could not possibly understand how kate's phone still had reception. 'Are you going to answer it?' whispered Jay. Kate looked at her phone and saw 'No caller ID', so she hesitated. 'What are you waiting for? answer. It might be someone we know...we need help,' said John. Kate's heart started beating faster and faster. She answered, 'Hello, who is this?' There was no reply. In that exact moment Jay knew something was wrong and that the person who was calling was not to be trusted. She repeated, 'hello. hellooooo....whoever this is, this is not funny.' There was a sudden loud beep noise and then the call ended. Just as things could not get any worse, Kate received an anonymous message straight after the mysterious call. It said, 'Be Safe kids'. What could that creepy message possible mean? And who was it from? Jay got sudden goosebumps and could not take it anymore. They all wished they had not left their house in the first place. John claimed that it might be some creep who followed them this whole time. KAte decided to just ignore what had happened, switched off her phone and put it back in her pocket. 'Ok guys, there are no more signs of the Jaguar, we need to get back home as soon as possible before it gets dark,' said kate. As soon as they got up and were ready to walk back home, they realized that they had no idea where they were. They tried to track down their footsteps but it was useless. There were no traces or signs as to where the way back was. They were all cold, hungry, thirsty and tired. John finally had an idea and told Kate to switch her phone back on.
