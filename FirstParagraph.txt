Jay and Kate could not believe what they were seeing in front of them. The path they took lead them to a beautiful rain forest. Birds were chirping and the flowers were in full bloom. All of a sudden, Jay and Kate heard a noise behind them. A young boy came running towards them and was out of breath. After speaking with the young boy, Jay and Kate learned more about him. They discovered that the young boy was lost in the forest. The young boy's name was John and he came to the forest with his school for a conservation study. He was distracted by the sighting of a  jaguar and lost his group. John had wandered around for five days. Kate and Jay inquired how John could survive in the forest and learned that John was a avid camper and hiker. He knew how to track down water and could identify poisonous plants from non poisonous plants. John was out of breath because he had been running away from the jaguar that he saw on the first day. Kate and Jay were terrified after hearing stories about the jaguar and were at a loss for what to do. Suddenly, they heard a growl behind them. As they turned around, they were met with the sight of the jaguar. Jay, Kate, and John all started to run frantically. Kate kept on looking behind her and could see the jaguar getting closer and closer. She did not know what to do in their situation. Jay decided that the best way for them to avoid the jaguar was to hide in the thick foliage of the rain forest. He mentioned for Kate and John to follow him into the plants and found a thick bush to hide behind. Everything was quiet for now.
